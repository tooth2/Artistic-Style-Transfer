# Style-Transfer-Example
This example projects demonstrate the use of Style Transfer in python, iOS, Android mobile applications. 

## Artistic-Style-Transfer
Artistic style transfer takes two images for input: a content image and a style image (such as an artwork by a 
famous painter or a texture photo to resemble) and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, 
but "painted" in the style of the style reference image.

### Structure 
Main folder contains two notebooks. 
* PyTorch VGG-19 pretrained model based style transfer
* Tensorflow Inception v3 pretrained model based style transfer
