# # Style Transfer with Deep Neural Networks
# 
# 
# In this notebook, weâ€™ll *recreate* a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch.
# 
# In this paper, style transfer uses the features found in the 19-layer VGG Network, which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and a few fully-connected layers. In the image below, the convolutional layers are named by stack and their order in the stack. Conv_1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack. Conv_2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the *second* stack. The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv_5_4.

# 
# ### Separating Style and Content
# 
# Style transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, we aim to create a new, _target_ image which should contain our desired content and style components:
# * objects and their arrangement are similar to that of the **content image**
# * style, colors, and textures are similar to that of the **style image**
# 
# An example is shown below, where the content image is of a cat, and the style image is of [Hokusai's Great Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa). The generated target image still contains the cat but is stylized with the waves, blue and beige colors, and block print textures of the style image!
# 
# <img src='notebook_ims/style_tx_cat.png' width=80% />
# 
# In this notebook, we'll use a pre-trained VGG19 Net to extract content or style features from a passed in image. We'll then formalize the idea of content and style _losses_ and use those to iteratively update our target image until we get a result that we want.

# ## Load in VGG19 (features)

# VGG19 is split into two portions:

# * `vgg19.classifier`, which are the three linear, classifier layers at the end
# 
# We only need the `features` portion, which we're going to load in and "freeze" the weights of, below.

# ### Load in Content and Style Images
# 
# You can load in any images you want! Below, we've provided a helper function for loading in any type and size of image. The `load_image` function also converts images to normalized Tensors.

# Additionally, it will be easier to have smaller images and to squish the content and style images so that they are of the same size.

# ## VGG19 Layers

# ## Gram Matrix 
# 
# The output of every convolutional layer is a Tensor with dimensions associated with the `batch_size`, a depth, `d` and some height and width (`h`, `w`). The Gram matrix of a convolutional layer can be calculated as follows:
# * Get the depth, height, and width of a tensor using `batch_size, d, h, w = tensor.size()`
# * Reshape that tensor so that the spatial dimensions are flattened
# * Calculate the gram matrix by multiplying the reshaped tensor by it's transpose 
# 
# *Note: You can multiply two matrices using `torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2)`.*
# 
# #### TODO: Complete the `gram_matrix` function.

# In[90]:


def gram_matrix(tensor):
    """ Calculate the Gram Matrix of a given tensor 
        Gram Matrix: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramian_matrix

    # calculate the gram matrix
    gram = torch.mm(tensor, tensor.t())
    
    return gram 


# ## Putting it all Together
# 
# Now that we've written functions for extracting features and computing the gram matrix of a given convolutional layer; let's put all these pieces together! We'll extract our features from our images and calculate the gram matrices for each layer in our style representation.

# In[91]:


# get content and style features only once before forming the target image
content_features = get_features(content, vgg)
style_features = get_features(style, vgg)

# calculate the gram matrices for each layer of our style representation
style_grams = {layer: gram_matrix(style_features[layer]) for layer in style_features}

# create a third "target" image and prep it for change
# it is a good idea to start of with the target as a copy of our *content* image
# then iteratively change its style
target = content.clone().requires_grad_(True).to(device)


# ---
# ## Loss and Weights
# 
# #### Individual Layer Style Weights
# 
# Below, you are given the option to weight the style representation at each relevant layer. It's suggested that you use a range between 0-1 to weight these layers. By weighting earlier layers (`conv1_1` and `conv2_1`) more, you can expect to get _larger_ style artifacts in your resulting, target image. Should you choose to weight later layers, you'll get more emphasis on smaller features. This is because each layer is a different size and together they create a multi-scale style representation!
# 
# #### Content and Style Weight
# 
# Just like in the paper, we define an alpha (`content_weight`) and a beta (`style_weight`). This ratio will affect how _stylized_ your final image is. It's recommended that you leave the content_weight = 1 and set the style_weight to achieve the ratio you want.

# In[92]:


# weights for each style layer 
# weighting earlier layers more will result in *larger* style artifacts
# notice we are excluding `conv4_2` our content representation
style_weights = {'conv1_1': 1.,
                 'conv2_1': 0.95,
                 'conv3_1': 0.75,
                 'conv4_1': 0.5,
                 'conv5_1': 0.1}

# you may choose to leave these as is
content_weight = 1  # alpha
style_weight = 1e6  # beta


# ## Updating the Target & Calculating Losses
# 
# You'll decide on a number of steps for which to update your image, this is similar to the training loop that you've seen before, only we are changing our _target_ image and nothing else about VGG19 or any other image. Therefore, the number of steps is really up to you to set! **I recommend using at least 2000 steps for good results.** But, you may want to start out with fewer steps if you are just testing out different weight values or experimenting with different images.
# 
# Inside the iteration loop, you'll calculate the content and style losses and update your target image, accordingly.
# 
# #### Content Loss
# 
# The content loss will be the mean squared difference between the target and content features at layer `conv4_2`. This can be calculated as follows: 
# ```
# content_loss = torch.mean((target_features['conv4_2'] - content_features['conv4_2'])**2)
# ```
# 
# #### Style Loss
# 
# The style loss is calculated in a similar way, only you have to iterate through a number of layers, specified by name in our dictionary `style_weights`. 
# > You'll calculate the gram matrix for the target image, `target_gram` and style image `style_gram` at each of these layers and compare those gram matrices, calculating the `layer_style_loss`. 
# > Later, you'll see that this value is normalized by the size of the layer.
# 
# #### Total Loss
# 
# Finally, you'll create the total loss by adding up the style and content losses and weighting them with your specified alpha and beta!
# 
# Intermittently, we'll print out this loss; don't be alarmed if the loss is very large. It takes some time for an image's style to change and you should focus on the appearance of your target image rather than any loss value. Still, you should see that this loss decreases over some number of iterations.
